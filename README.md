# Sales-Data-Analysis---Finding-profits-behind-the-number
This project is a beginner-friendly Sales Data Analysis designed to understand business insights from sales records. It uses Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Excel to explore, visualize, and summarize key patterns in the dataset. The goal is to find which regions, categories, and months perform best and how discounts affect profits.
